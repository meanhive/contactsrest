Everything should work fine. It is now time to setup our controller to handle API request and Model to save/retrieve data from the database. We will implement a simple data model the stores contact information with the following details:

    Name
    Email
    Phone
    Gender

We will implement the following endpoints

    GET /api/contacts list all contacts
    POST /api/contacts create new contact
    GET /api/contacts/{id} retrieve a single contact
    PUT /api/contacts/{id} update a single contact
    DELETE /api/contacts/{id} delete a single contact
